                            We are a teacher-turned-developer and a mechanical engineering student united by our love for running, weightlifting, 
                            and golf. The idea for SkillJa was born during countless shared workouts, where we realized how challenging it can be 
                            to find the right coach to meet individual goals. <br /> <br/>

                            Frustrated by the lack of centralized resources for athletes to discover quality coaching, we decided to build a solution. 
                            Rooted in Toronto and powered by our values of integrity, respect, discipline, and teamwork, we're on a mission to make 
                            coaching accessible to everyone, no matter the sport or location. <br /> <br />

                            With SkillJa, we hope to empower athletes to achieve their best and give coaches a platform to share their expertise with 
                            the world.
